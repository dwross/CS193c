    <p>I'm a <span class="stanfordRed">Stanford</span> Center for Professional Development (SCPD) student and CS193c will be the 17th class I've taken in the <span class="stanfordRed">Stanford</span> Computer Science department.  My previous education is a BS in Physics and Mathematics from the University of San Francisco followed by a Master in High Energy Astrophysics from the Univeristy of California at Irvine.  As part of my research at UCI, I traveled to the South Pole 3 times helping to build a neutrino telescope called <a href="https://icecube.wisc.edu/" class="external"> IceCube</a>.</p>
    <p>I am a Senior Systems/Software Engineer at Boeing.  Over the last 4 years I've been mainly responsible for developing the enterprise virtual and augmented reality capability.  This entails leading the development of applications using game engines such as Unreal and Unity.  These applications are targeted for various platforms from the Microsoft Hololens to the Vive, down to the GearVR.  My interest in taking 193c is that, as a side project, I've been involved in developing a web based production application that tracks a plane build, real-time, from start to finish.</p>
    <p>A few of the things I like to do outside of work and school are:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><a href="https://www.bbc.com/sport/football" class="external">Soccer</a></li>
        <li><a href="https://www.lonelyplanet.com/" class="external">Travel</a></li>
        <li><a href="http://olympixfitness.com/" class="external">Working Out</a></li>
    </ul>
