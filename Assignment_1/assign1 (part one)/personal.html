    <h1 class="myName">David W Ross</h1>
    <p>I'm a <span class="stanfordRed">Stanford</span> Center for Professional Development (SCPD) student and CS193c will be the 17th class
        I've taken in the <span class="stanfordRed">Stanford</span> Computer Science department.  My previous education is a BS in Physics and Mathematics
        from the University of San Francisco followed by a Master in High Energy Astrophysics from the
        Univeristy of California at Irvine.  As part of my research at UCI, I traveled to the South Pole 3 times helping
        to build a neutrino telescope called <a href="https://icecube.wisc.edu/">IceCube</a>.</p>
    <p>I am a Senior Systems/Software Engineer at Boeing.  Over the last 4 years I've been mainly responsible for 
        developing the enterprise virtual and augmented reality capability.  This entails leading the development
        of applications using game engines such as Unreal and Unity.  These applications are targeted for various platforms
        from the Microsoft Hololens to the Vive, down to the Gear VR.  My interest in taking 193c is that as a side project,
        I've been involved in developing a web based production application that tracks a plane build, real-time, from 
        start to finish.
