    <h1>David W Ross</h1>
    <p>I'm a Stanford Center for Professional Development (SCPD) student and CS193c will be the 17th class
        I've taken in the Stanford Computer Science department.  My previous education is a BS in Physics and Mathematics
        from the University of San Francsico followed by a Master in High Energy Astrophysics from the
        Univeristy of California at Irvine.  As part of my research at UCI, I traveled to the South Pole 3 times helping
        to build a neutrino telescope called <a href="https://icecube.wisc.edu/">IceCube</a>.</p>
    <p>blah blah</p>
    <p>A few of the things I like to do outside of work and school are:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><a href="https://www.bbc.com/sport/football">Soccer</a></li>
        <li><a href="https://www.lonelyplanet.com/">Travel</a></li>
        <li><a href="http://olympixfitness.com/">Working Out</a></li>
    </ul>
